stuff to do
- condense the file: check
- add function to main program: check
- run twice, document and summary: check
- get the key words
- compare the vectors of the keywords


What we learned
- our summary is not long enough to create training examples
- can't have all text in one line, but also need enough words

- instead of training a serparte word2vec model with the summary text, 
we could use the weights of the document word2vec and try to evaluate the summary
using n-skip grams
